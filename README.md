### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd family-restaurant-picker
npm install
```

### 2. Firebase Setup

#### Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Firebase project credentials:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com

#### Set up Firebase service account:
1. Download your Firebase service account JSON file
2. Save it as `firebase-service-account.json` in the project root

#### Populate Firestore with initial data:
```bash
node scripts/migrate-to-firestore.js
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run client:dev
```

### 4. Access the Application

- Frontend: http://localhost:3001
- Authentication: Firebase Auth

- `restaurants` - Restaurant information with populated cuisine data
- `cuisines` - Available cuisine types (reference data)
- `dietaryRestrictions` - Available dietary restrictions (reference data)

## Key Features Implementation

### Cuisine Categories
The system includes comprehensive cuisine categorization:

**Traditional Cuisines:**
- American, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Thai
- Mediterranean, French, Greek, Vietnamese, Korean
- BBQ, Seafood, Steakhouse

**Specialty Food Categories (NEW):**
- **Dessert & Ice Cream** - Ice cream shops, dessert parlors, specialty sweet treats
- **Bakery & Pastries** - Bakeries, pastry shops, fresh baked goods  
- **Cafe & Coffee** - Coffee shops, cafes, light breakfast/lunch spots

### Dietary Restrictions Support
The system supports the following dietary restrictions out of the box:
- Gluten Free (prominently featured as requested)
- Vegetarian
- Vegan
- Dairy Free
- Nut Allergy
- Shellfish Allergy
- Kosher
- Halal
- Low Sodium
- Diabetic Friendly

### Recommendation Algorithm
The recommendation engine works by:

1. **Filtering**: Only shows restaurants that accommodate ALL dietary restrictions of selected family members
2. **Scoring**: Restaurants are scored (0-100) based on:
   - Base availability (10 points for existing restaurant)
   - Cuisine preferences (up to 30 points based on family preferences, 1-5 scale)
   - Dietary accommodation (up to 30 points for accommodating all restrictions)
   - Restaurant rating (up to 20 points based on star rating)
   - Price consideration (up to 10 points for budget-friendly options)
3. **Ranking**: Results are sorted by score, highest first
4. **Favorite Boost**: Favorited restaurants receive a 10% score boost (capped at 100%)

**Recent Fixes:**
- Fixed dietary restriction matching bug that prevented proper scoring
- Improved cuisine preference data handling for accurate recommendations

### Input Validation
All API endpoints include comprehensive validation:
- Required fields validation
- Data type checking
- Range validation (ratings 0-5, price range 1-4, preference levels 1-5)
- Email format validation
- URL format validation

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check database credentials in `.env`
- Verify database names exist

### Port Conflicts
- Change PORT in `.env` if 3000 is occupied
- Frontend dev server runs on 3001 by default

- Ensure database exists before running migrations
- Check PostgreSQL user permissions
- Reset database if needed: `npm run db:reset`
